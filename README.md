# project-AnalyzingExoplanetsusingTransitFinderData

datatype of the attributes:
Epoch: The epoch is typically given in Julian Date (JD), which is a standard astronomical time measurement in days since the Julian calendar's starting point.

Epoch Uncertainty: This is usually given in days (JD), representing the uncertainty in the timing of the epoch.

Period: The period is typically given in days and represents the orbital period of the exoplanet.

Period Uncertainty: This is also given in days and represents the uncertainty in the determination of the orbital period.

Duration: The duration is given in hours, indicating the length of time during which the transit event occurs.
