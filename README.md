# Project Title

Analyzing Exoplanets using Transit Finder Data

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to **Predict Future Transits** of exoplanets using transit finder data. By utilizing the transit epoch and period information, we aim to develop a predictive model that allows astronomers to anticipate when future transits of exoplanets will occur.

## Dataset(s) Used

We have used the TESS Objects of Interest (TOI) dataset, which includes information about 6873 TOIs. You can access the dataset in a CSV format [here](https://astro.swarthmore.edu/transits/toi_targets.csv). This dataset serves as the foundation for our analysis and predictions.

## Introduction

Predicting future transits of exoplanets is a crucial aspect of exoplanetary research. It enables astronomers to effectively plan their observation schedules, gather more data, and study the behavior of exoplanets over time. Our project focuses on harnessing the power of transit finder data to achieve this goal.

## Key Findings

In the course of this project, we have successfully identified and predicted the occurrence of the next transit event using the available transit finder data. This outcome represents a significant milestone in exoplanetary research, as it provides astronomers with valuable insights into exoplanetary behavior and transit patterns.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

This project has demonstrated the feasibility of predicting future transits efficiently. As the next steps, we recommend:

- Refining the predictive model to enhance accuracy.
- Expanding the dataset to include a wider range of exoplanets for more comprehensive analysis.
- Developing user-friendly tools or applications that astronomers can use to plan their observation schedules based on transit predictions.

We believe that these steps will contribute to the advancement of exoplanetary research and our understanding of exoplanets' behavior through predictive modeling.
